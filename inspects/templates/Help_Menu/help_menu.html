This feature is useful for the officer transferred to a new post, to update employee number (IPAS no.) of an officer posted on a particular designation or to change posting status, password, etc. Firstly, users have to enter their Email address linked with their new designation, (if email is not available, the user can raise a request to register their new email id). Once email id is entered, the designation corresponding to email will be autofetched in the designation field and the Get OTP button will become active to receive an OTP on registered email for the self-authorization purpose.

                        <p>Officers have access to a comprehensive list of inspection notes. These inspection notes are specifically marked for particular inspection paragraphs (or inspection criteria) that need to be addressed. The purpose of these inspection notes is to ensure that the necessary actions are taken to comply with the requirements outlined in the inspection paragraphs. The inspection notes are typically generated during the inspection process when officers identify areas that require attention or improvements. Once these inspection notes are created, they are forwarded to subordinate officers, responsible for implementing the necessary changes and ensuring compliance with the corresponding inspection paragraphs. Within the list of inspection notes, officers have the ability to view additional details related to each note. This includes the inspection para it is associated with and the status of its compliance. Officers can conveniently access the inspection note in PDF format by clicking on the PDF icon provided. Officers can access and review remarks or comments provided by subordinate officers regarding inspection notes to gain insights into the actions taken or planned for addressing inspection requirements. They can conveniently access these remarks by clicking on the 'Remarks' button under the 'View' column for the respective inspection note.

In addition to the structured fields, there is a dedicated Remarks section where officers can elaborate on their experience with the portal in detail. This allows them to provide a comprehensive narrative, addressing specific aspects, concerns, or suggestions they may have. To supplement their feedback, officers are also given the opportunity to upload relevant photos. This feature enables them to visually illustrate their points, providing valuable context and supporting their feedback with visual evidence when necessary.</p>

            <p>Within this module, officers will have access to the comprehensive hierarchy of railway staff, which proves to be highly convenient for allocating tasks and assignments for various purposes. This hierarchy provides officers with a clear understanding of the organisational structure, enabling them to select suitable personnel for specific roles and responsibilities, particularly in the context of inspections.</p>
            <p>To streamline the process, officers can utilise the available fields such as RLY./Org (Railway/Organization), Division/Unit, and Department wise.

This targeted approach ensures that the right individual is selected for each inspection, optimising efficiency and effectiveness. By utilising this module, officers can leverage the hierarchical information to facilitate task allocation and enhance the overall management of inspections within the railway system. </p>
